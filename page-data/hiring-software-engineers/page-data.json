However, regarding tasks below, it does not seem appropriate to assign such tasks to free-lancers.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research for technologies and documents. Enhancement of development environment.</li>\n<li>Development of new products.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First, we ask free-lancers to take care of their main tasks such as programming or design. To ask them to perform a lot of other work seems uncomfortable for both of us. However, without having background knowledge of programming or design, asking for just research from other third parties is unrealistic.</p>\n<p>Secondly, to develop new products or services, the skill is very important but also having background knowledge and a strong will helps to stick to details. Free-lancers are usually providing their skills to earn money so we think that we cannot ask them for other things that are not directly related to their work style.</p>\n<p>It will be also nice if any free-lancers had a sense of identification with our company products or service, but then they could loose advantages working as free-lancers.</p>\n<p>The full-time worker in our company can work the same as free-lancers as you can see in their working conditions.</p>\n<h1></h1>\n<h2><strong>Contact Us</strong></h2>\n<p>If you just casually want to know more or you are interested in this position, please do not hesitate to <a href=\"mailto:info@mobalab.net\">contact us</a>.</p>\n"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cbd330fe-e90b-505d-8ab7-6f041d858de7"}}}
